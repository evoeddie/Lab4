# Lab4: One Task is (almost) Never Enough

## Overview
For this lab, we will be making a real-time multitasking to control multiple motors simultaneously
using a closed-loop control. We will see how we can properly demonstrate the ability to schedule
tasks efficiently to still have proper control over multiple devices concurrently. 

We will then run our task on the motor with a flywheel while plotting the results to compare
step response, both in slow and slower rate to then compare the controller's performance.
Finally, we will make two tasks that run two motors under closed-loop control at the same time.


## Single Motor Control Task

## Step Response Analysis

## Dual Motor Control Task
